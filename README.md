Rails Wishlist
==

Did you ever feel the need to have a wishlist that's not hosted at some vendor's shop? Well, we did. We
thought the world would need a simple wishlist written in rails.

Scope
--

Single-Purpose, Single-User Wishlist. Wishes can be added by the site-owner. Wishes can be "claimed" by any
visitor that supplies an e-mailadress. That person then has to find the article in question and buy it for the
site-owner.
